# Decision tree and random forest
Random Forest Project 
For this project i will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor i would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. i will try to create a model that will help predict this.
Lending club had a very interesting year in 2016, so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.
I will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
